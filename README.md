## Dependencies

* ROS Kinetic
* Catkin
* roscpp package
* std_msgs package
* message_generation package
* tf package

## Build/Run Steps

First, create and build a catkin workspace if you do not have one already

```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

To add your catkin workspace into the ROS enviroment you need to source the generated setup file.

```
$ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

To download this repository to your catkin workpace do the following steps:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ mkdir week11hw
$ cd week11hw
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/rubenacevedo3/beginner_tutorials.git
$ git pull origin Week11_HW
```

To build any catkin projects found in the src folder use: 
```
# In a catkin workspace
$ catkin_make
```

To build any test found in the test folder use: 
```
# In a catkin workspace
$ catkin_make test
```

To run the launch file:

(In terminal 1)
```
$ roscore
```

(In terminal 2)
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source ./devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch beginner_tutorials modifyPubFreq.launch
```

To run the tests: 
(In terminal 3)
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source ./devel/setup.bash
$ rostest beginner_tutorials talkerTest.launch
```

## Run cpplint 

Use cpplint to identify potential source code issues that are in conflict with the Google C++ style guide. 

To install and run from terminal:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
$ sudo pip install cpplint
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/week11hw/beginner_tutorials
$ cpplint $( find . -name \*.hpp -or -name \*.cpp | grep -vE -e "^./build/" -e "^./vendor/" -e "^./docs/" -e "^./results" )
```

## Run cppcheck 

Use cppcheck for static code analysis.

To run from terminal:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/week11hw/beginner_tutorials
$ cppcheck --enable=all --std=c++11 -I include/ --suppress=missingIncludeSystem $( find . -name *.cpp | grep -vE -e "^./build/" -e "^./vendor/" )
```
