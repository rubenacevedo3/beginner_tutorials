## Build/Run Steps

First, create and build a catkin workspace if you do not have one already

```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

To add your catkin workspace into the ROS enviroment you need to source the generated setup file.

```
$ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

To download this repository to your catkin workpace do the following steps:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ mkdir -p ~/week10hw
$ cd ~/week10hw
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/rubenacevedo3/beginner_tutorials.git
$ git pull origin Week10_HW
```

To build any catkin projects found in the src folder use: 
```
# In a catkin workspace
$ catkin_make
```

## How to run cpplint 

Use cpplint to identify potential source code issues that are in conflict with the Google C++ style guide. 

To install and run from terminal:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/cpplint/cpplint.py (Links to an external site.)
Change permission to executable: chmod +x cpplint.py
cd <repository>
Run cpplint
Example run with cpp-boilerplate (cpplint.py is in the parent directory):

cd cpp-boilerplate

../cpplint.py --extensions=h,hpp,cpp $( find . -name *.h -or -name *.hpp -or -name *.cpp | grep -vE -e "^./build/" -e "^./vendor/" )

This command runs cpplint.py and tells the script to examine files with extension .h, .hpp, or .cpp. The script expects a list of files so the bash command first finds all files in the directory and sub-directories that have the extension .h, .hpp, or .cpp. It then excludes any file found in the build or vendor sub-directories.

## How to run cppcheck 

Use cppcheck for static code analysis using the command-line from repository root "RoboDogVoiceController-eclipse"

cppcheck --enable=all --std=c++11 -I include/ --suppress=missingIncludeSystem $( find . -name *.cpp | grep -vE -e "^./build/" -e "^./vendor/" )
